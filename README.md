# What is Object Tracking?
<p>Object Tracking means predicting object location at some future point in time. So object tracking in a video is basically estimating the location of an object in subsequent frames. This can be done by developing both a <i>motion model</i> and an <i>appearance model</i>.
</p>

<p>The motion model will estimate the position and velocity of a particular object in pixel coordinates and then use that information to predict its location in future video frames. Then the appearance model, which encodes what the object looks like, will search the region around the predicted location from the motion model to fine-tune the location of the object.</p>

<p>In this demonstration we will use OpenCV API tracker class. So as a concrete example suppose we're interested in tracking a specific object like the race car identified here in the first frame of a video clip. In order to initiate the tracking algorithm we need to specify the initial location of the object and to do this we define a bounding box shown here in blue which consists of two sets of pixel coordinates which define the upper left and lower right corners of the bounding box. Once the tracking algorithm is initialized with this information the goal is to then track the object in subsequent video frames by producing a bounding box in each new video frame</p> 

before we get started with the code description let's just take a look at the tracking algorithms available in opencv. there's eight different algorithms listed here and we're not going to go through the details of each one but it's worth noting that depending on your application one model might be more suitable than the other. for example some are more accurate some are faster some are more robust to occlusions of the object being tracked so that's just something to keep in mind as you experiment with the algorithms for a particular application you may have in mind and then one other thing that's worth mentioning here is that the go turn model is the only one that's deep learning based and we'll talk a little bit more about that further below. 

Note that after OpenCV 4.5.0 custom algorithms were moved to the contrib [repo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib). The policy is when an algorithm is mature enough it is moved to the main repo.

so just as a preview to get started
we've got a test video clip here and
let's just play it one or two times
so you'll notice that early on the car's
appearance is relatively constant and
its motion is fairly uniform
but as it starts to make the turn here
the perspective is more from the
broadside portion of the car
and then also the lighting is starting
to change quite a bit
and then now toward the end it's getting
smaller and smaller off into the
distance
so those types of things are going to
represent some challenges for some of
the tracking algorithms and as we work
through this demo we'll point out
situations where one particular
algorithm is having a difficult time due
to factors like some of these that we've
pointed out
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
first code Block in the notebook here
we're importing some modules that are
required and then on line 10 we're
indicating the file name for the video
clip that we're going to process
and then here we're defining some
convenience functions that will allow us
to render a bounded box information on
the output video stream as well as
annotate the output video frames with
some text
and then recall earlier that we
mentioned the go turn model is a deep
learning based model
and this model uses a neural network to
help us predict where the bounding box
will be in a subsequent video frame
and so this block of code here is
required to download that inference
model
and then this figure here is a very high
level description of how the go turn
tracker is trained and used
so in the center here we're indicating
that we have a pre-trained neural
network model also known as an inference
model
and it takes as input two cropped images
one from the previous frame and one from
the current frame
and it uses the bounding box from the
previous frame to crop both of these
images and therefore the object of
interest is located in the center of the
previous frame
and obviously if the object is moved in
the current frame then it won't be
centered in this cropped image because
we're using the bounding box from the
previous frame to crop both of the
images and so it's the job of the
inference model to then predict what the
bounding box is from the output frame
here
so that's just a very high level
description of how that model works
so let's go ahead and continue on and
take a look at the next code block
so this is where we're going to create a
Tracker instance and we start by
defining a list of tracker types that
are available in the opencv API
and then depending on the tracking
algorithm that we'd like to execute you
would just set the appropriate index
here into that list and since this is uh
specified as 2 then we'd be indicating
that we'd like to execute the KCF
tracker
and then this if else block is the logic
that's used to call the appropriate
class to create the tracker object
so in the case of the default we'd be
calling the tracker KCF underscore
create class to create a Tracker object
of that class
so let's continue on to the next section
where we're going to set up the input
output video streams
so here on line two we're passing in the
video input file name to the video
capture class and that's creating for us
a video input object
and then on the next line we're going to
go ahead and read the first frame from
that video file and that returns for us
a logical as to whether or not that
operation was successful and then the
second return value is the first frame
from that video which we'll use further
below
and then down here on lines 13 and 14
we're doing a similar thing for the
output video stream creating a video
output object and this is going to be
used so that we can annotate the output
video with results from our tracking
algorithm
so now we're at the point where we can
initialize the tracker and to do that
we're going to define a bounding box
around the object that we're interested
in tracking
and here we're doing that manually by
specifying a set of pixel coordinates
that Define the upper left and lower
right corners
of a bounding box around the car
in practice you would um probably select
this using a user interface or perhaps
use a detection algorithm to detect the
objects of interest
programmatically but for demonstration
purposes we're just going to manually
Define the initial bounding box that
identifies the location of the car in
the very first video frame
and then next we're ready to initialize
the tracker and so to do that we use the
tracker object that we defined above and
we call the init method for that tracker
object and we pass in the first frame of
the video clip as well as the bounding
box that we just defined above
and then once that tracker has been
initialized we can then process all the
remaining frames in the video and we can
accomplish that in the following Loop
so here on line two we're reading in the
next frame from the video
and then on line 10 we're passing that
frame to the tracker's update function
and that returns two values one is a
logical that indicates whether a
detection was made and if a detection
was made we get the bounding box
coordinates for that detection
and then next we can compute the frames
per second using these convenience
functions in opencv
and then coming down to line 16 if a
detection was made then we'll call the
draw rectangle function to render a
bounding box on the current frame
otherwise we'll display a tracking
failure message
and then further below we annotate the
frame with the tracker type and also the
frames per second which we calculated up
above and then finally each time through
this Loop we write out the current frame
to the video output stream
so that's all there is to it this Loop
Cycles through each frame in the video
clip calls the tracker update function
and then annotates the frames
accordingly depending on whether or not
a detection was made
so let's scroll down a bit further here
and take a look at some results
so all of these results that we're going
to take a look at here are output
streams that were annotated with
tracking results and we're just going to
play them back in the notebook
so as you can see in this first example
this is the KCF tracker and I'm going to
go ahead and play this and we'll take a
look at how it performs
so it looks like it's doing a fairly
good job of tracking the car a little
bit off center but still maintaining
track on what's obviously the car in the
video frame and then as the car rounds
the corner it's doing okay and then
shortly here we're going to see that it
has a little bit of a difficulty right
here at the end it drops track on the
car
and as we go through other examples in
this notebook you'll notice that each of
The Trackers tends to have difficulty in
different ways so let's go ahead and
take a look at the next example which is
the csrt tracker and notice that this
one does a little better job of tracking
the car with a bounding box encompassing
the entire car and centered on the car
for pretty much the first portion of the
video
but then also notice that towards the
end of the video when the car is making
the turn the tracker is a little bit
biased towards the front of the car and
then at the end of the video it's kind
of leading the car a little bit so it
doesn't drop track but the location is a
little bit off there towards the end
so let's go ahead and take a look at our
final example which is the go turn
tracker which is the only tracking model
in opencv that's based on a neural
network so let's have a look
so initially the tracker looks like it's
doing a really nice job like the other
trackers maintaining uh the bounding box
pretty much centered on the car
and then also through the turn notice
that the bounding box even though it's
changing shape is still really centered
on the car and even at the very end of
the video here where the other trackers
had more difficulty the go turn tracker
is still able to maintain a fairly
accurate position for the car so out of
these three examples all the trackers
were able to do a fairly good job near
the beginning
but as it became more challenging as the
cars around in the corner and going off
into the distance the go turn tracker
was the the most robust in this case
maintaining a pretty accurate track
throughout the entire video stream right
up until the end there so we hope that
gives you a good feel for how to
exercise the various tracking algorithms
in opencv and especially the small
amount of code that's required in order
to get something up and running so we
really encourage you to experiment
further with this notebook try some of
your own videos and experiment with
various algorithms and we hope this was
helpful to you and we'll see you next
time thanks so much
